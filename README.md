# Android Course Qualifiers on Codeforces
<b>All classes for solution are in one file due to CodeForces rules.</b>

Watch first task in ```first.PNG``` .

Solve it with finding the amount of components of a graph. Just use ```DFS```
to find one component and mark component's nodes as ```used```. Then use ```DFS``` from other unused nodes and etcetera.
Solution code for the first task is in ```firsttask.InterestsUnion.java```. 

Then watch ```second.PNG``` for the second task.

Solution code for the second task is in ```SecondInOneFile.java```. 
Test examples are in ```secondtask.tests.txt```. Copy the input until ```~``` and put it into program. Result must be
same as text under ```~```.

I passed this qualifiers and the first task was to rewrite second task to Kotlin.
U can find it in ```SecondTaskOnKotlin.kt```.
